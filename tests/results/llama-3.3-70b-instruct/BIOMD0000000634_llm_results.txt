Synonyms:
ROS: ['reactive oxygen species', 'free radical', 'oxidizing agent']
damDNA: ['damaged DNA', 'DNA damage', 'oxidized DNA']
ATP: ['adenosine triphosphate', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP molecule']
ADP: ['adenosine diphosphate', "adenosine 5'-diphosphate", 'ADP molecule']
AMP: ['adenosine monophosphate', "adenosine 5'-monophosphate", 'AMP molecule']

Reason: The species names are matched to their common biochemical names based on their display names and reaction equations. ROS is identified as reactive oxygen species due to its involvement in oxidative stress and DNA damage reactions. damDNA is recognized as damaged DNA due to its production in the "DNAdamage" reaction and consumption in the "DNArepair" reaction. ATP, ADP, and AMP are identified as adenine nucleotides based on their participation in energy transfer reactions, such as the "E1UbBinding" and "Degradationp53_Ub4" reactions.
