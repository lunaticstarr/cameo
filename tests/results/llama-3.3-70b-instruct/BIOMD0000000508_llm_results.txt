Synonyms:
x: ['UNK']
ip3: ['inositol trisphosphate', 'myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate', 'D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate']
atp: ['adenosine triphosphate', "adenosine 5'-triphosphate", 'ATP']
y: ['UNK']
ca: ['calcium', 'calcium ion', 'Ca2+']

Reason: x and y are unknown because no display names or clear descriptions are given for these species. ip3 is likely inositol trisphosphate due to its common involvement in calcium signaling pathways. atp is clearly adenosine triphosphate, a common energy transfer molecule in cells. ca is likely calcium, given the model's focus on calcium-cell cycle coupling and the common use of "ca" as an abbreviation for calcium in biological models.
