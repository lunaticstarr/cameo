Reason: The species were identified based on their display names and roles in the polyamine metabolism model. SAM, A, P, S, D, aS, aD, Met, and ORN were directly matched to their display names, while AcCoA and CoA were identified based on their common biochemical abbreviations. The standardized names and synonyms were selected based on their common usage in biochemical literature and databases such as ChEBI.
